        <pre
            class="para">            We always believed that the satisfaction of the customer should be prioritized over other factors for a successful business. 
            With this as our mission to achieve, we established our own company in 2000 and named it as “The Royal Seat Travel Agency”. We have also 
            expanded our service area from local to regional by introducing tour packages in 2005.

            We now offer national tour destinations with packages for all over India and outbound tour operations. We are now capable of handling tours 
            for couples and group travels like corporate, family, school, college, etc.,
            
            Owing to our exponential growth, the name of the company has been changed to Bharani Tours and Travels since 2016.</pre>
